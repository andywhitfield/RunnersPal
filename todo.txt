next:

run:log routes - support finding a new route
route:pal - saving a route doesn't do anything yet
route:pal - shouldn't allow saving of a route which isn't owned by the user...i.e. when finding a route.
run:log and route:pal...handle units change on my routes list
run:log routes - integrate bingmaps...support saving a log event against a new route
run:log - when viewing current run:log, if a mapped route, could provide link to route:pal (or perhaps inline)?
route:pal - support saving routes as part of login/reg process
check timezone...i.e. when adding an event, make sure it works when the client is in a US timezone, server is GMT/BST/whatever.
errors: ajax errors in general; errors logging in (e.g. no openid endpoint)!
final tidy up: remove anything that isn't implemented; clean up javascript/css; upload to github;
buy runnerspal.co.uk domain
release!
