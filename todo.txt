next:

run:log and route:pal...handle units change on my routes list
run:log - when viewing current run:log, if a mapped route, could provide link to route:pal (or perhaps inline)?
check timezone...i.e. when adding an event, make sure it works when the client is in a US timezone, server is GMT/BST/whatever.
route:pal/run:log - map start position
route:pal/run:log - distance markers change/units change
download all run:log events - just an ugly link at the moment. Needs to work when not logged in.
errors:
  ajax errors in general;
  add run:log - I moved the slideUp call to within the callback fn, which works much
                better when there are problems (e.g. missing mandatory fields), but doesn't
				look so nice in a 'normal' add scenario as there is a lag between hitting the
				button and the dialog dismissing.
  errors logging in (e.g. no openid endpoint)!
final tidy up:
  clean up HomeController login;
  remove anything that isn't implemented;
  clean up javascript/css;
  upload to github;
buy runnerspal.co.uk domain
release!

Post-release fixes/features:
----------------------------
security: review login cookie...if someone gets a user's login cookie, they become them.
login: support facebook
