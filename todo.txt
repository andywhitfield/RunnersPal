next:

route:pal - when viewing a public route, a save should save a copy (with prompt).
run:log and route:pal...handle units change on my routes list
run:log routes - integrate bingmaps...support saving a log event against a new route
run:log - when viewing current run:log, if a mapped route, could provide link to route:pal (or perhaps inline)?
check timezone...i.e. when adding an event, make sure it works when the client is in a US timezone, server is GMT/BST/whatever.
route:pal/run:log - map start position
route:pal/run:log - distance markers change/units change
download all run:log events - just an ugly link at the moment. Needs to work when not logged in.
errors: ajax errors in general; errors logging in (e.g. no openid endpoint)!
final tidy up:
  clean up HomeController login; remove anything that isn't implemented; clean up javascript/css; upload to github;
probably need to think about security a bit more...if someone gets a user's login cookie, they become them.
buy runnerspal.co.uk domain
release!
